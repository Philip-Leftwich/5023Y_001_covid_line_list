                    c("Module code","5023Y"),
                    c("Item number", "002"),

You are being provided with a fake dataset on COVID-19 linelist data^[A line list is a table that contains key information about each case in an outbreak, with each row representing a case and each column representing a variable such as demographic, clinical and epidemiologic information (e.g., risk factors and exposures)(https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson2/section1.html)]. As a group you must submit a report that uses this data to create an outbreak situation report (maximum two pages) that addresses any topics or trends that you deem relevant to inform an audience of public health and medical responders. 


# 2. Summative guidance

- This assessment is due **on or before: 3pm Thursday 16th December.**

- Produce ONE incredible data figure! 

- Write 500 words to accompany these figures explaining how they conform to good data visualisation practice.

## Guidance on project management

- Set up your RStudio Project in the **5023Y workspace**

- Organise your project

- Start by working in an R script build your script as you go - you can edit and change as you progress - make regular commits to GitHub

- **Always** end a session by pushing *to* Github. **Always** start a session by pulling *from* GitHub. 

- *Read this* on [workflow](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html)

- Make sure all required libraries are called *first* in the script

    - library() *goes in the script*

    - install.packages("") *NEVER goes in the script*


- Data tidying - check file has imported correctly, is there missing data? are there missing values? is it tidy? Are the data types correct? 

- Try exploratory visuals to *understand* the data

- Use the R script you have made as a source for an Rmarkdown file


## Guidance on data visuals

This is **not** a figure in a lab report - so titles, annotations, labelling, highlights etc. are all perfectly valid if they enhance the figure. This is a stand-alone piece, imagine you might present this on a poster, or use it as an information post on Instagram!

* It should have a clear take-home message, remember titles and short captions are often the most well retained part of a data visual, so make this count!

* This is for a general audience, so consider the types of geoms you will use *carefully*

* Don't overload the graph with too much information

* Focus on how you will make the important elements of the chart standout - colour, annotations, etc?

* Get inspired - here are some useful links - but do your own research - be inspired by others and imitate!
    (https://medium.economist.com/charting-new-territory-7f5afb293270)
    (https://www.consultantsmind.com/2019/11/09/economist-graphs/)

* Use colour - but be responsible and make it accessible


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/choose-chart.png")
```

## Guidance on write-up

The write-up is not about the message behind the visual. Instead I want 500 words on the decisions you made in constructing your visual. 

* Explain the chart type, and why it is appropriate

* Explain any data ordering, scaling or data manipulation

* Explain your use of colours or annotations

* Explain why your title or captions are appropriate

There are plenty of references available to you - make sure you evidence your statements with citations (reference list does not count to word count)


# 3. Hand in

The following should be part of your final project:

- An R script (with code comments) which succesfully reproduces the figure. 

- A saved png file of your ggplot data visual

- An Rmd file that sources your data visual and where you will include your 500 word write-up and references

- A knitted pdf output of your .rmd file. **This is the file you will hand in via Blackboard.**

- **HAND IN â€“ Thursday 16th DECEMBER**


# 4. Regulations and extensions

You should be familiar with University Regulations on:

- [Plagiarism](https://my.uea.ac.uk/departments/learning-and-teaching/students/academic-cycle/regulations-and-discipline/plagiarism-awareness)

- How to submit work to [Blackboard](https://my.uea.ac.uk/departments/learning-technology/students/submitting-an-assignment)

- [Submission regulations](https://my.uea.ac.uk/departments/learning-and-teaching/students/academic-cycle/coursework/submission-guide) (Including information on word counts and late penalties)

- [Extenuating Circumstances](https://my.uea.ac.uk/departments/learning-and-teaching/students/support/extenuating-circumstances) If you need help meeting your deadlines.
